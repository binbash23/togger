# togger
Tiny team todo sqlite database.

Just create a new SQLite Database. You can use [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) for this.

Then execute the togger.sql script.

You will have a table and some views to manage all your todo's with create and change date an state and so on. Use the DB Browser for SQLite as the editing tool for the todo table.

Best regards, Jens
