Tiny team todo sqlite database

Just create a new SQLite Database. You can use [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) for this.

Then execute the togger.sql script.

You will have a table and some views to manage all your todo's with create and change date an state and so on.

Best regards, Jens
